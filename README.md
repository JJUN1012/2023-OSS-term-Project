    + API Manual  
    https://www.its.go.kr/opendata/
+ Analyze the number of vehicles in CCTV videos using OpenCV
+ Transmit the analyzed inforamtion to a mobile app and visualize both the video stream and density of detected vehicles.
+ How to Use
To use the program:

Obtain an API key by following the API application process.
Create an "apiKey.txt" file in the datafiles folder.
Paste the API key into the "apiKey.txt" file.
During testing, you can use 'test' as a placeholder for the API key.

How to Apply for API?
Project Overview
Our goal is to provide a user-friendly program that enhances the convenience of accessing real-time highway traffic information. Utilizing the Korea Expressway Corporation's free API, we employ OpenCV to analyze images from CCTV cameras along highways. The program responds with user-friendly messages such as "Highway congestion detected" or "Traffic is smooth, proceed at a moderate speed."
