Project Overview
=================
Our goal is to provide a user-friendly program that enhances the convenience of accessing real-time highway traffic information. Utilizing the Korea Expressway Corporation's free API, we employ OpenCV to analyze images from CCTV cameras along highways. The program responds with user-friendly messages such as "Highway congestion detected" or "Traffic is smooth, proceed at a moderate speed."
